## ABOUT
👋 I'm Joe, a Full Stack Engineer based in London. After 8 years of working in marketing and client relations at a senior level at The Orchard/Sony Music, I decided on a change in trajectory and am about to complete the 12 week Software Engineering course at [@makersacademy](https://makers.tech/). Although I am very much at the start of my developing journey, I have laid some strong foundations and I am excited to find a company where I can utilise and build on my existing skill set. Creative thinking, absorbing knowledge and problem solving are all highly enjoyable for me and I enjoy contributing individually, but especially as part of a team. My constant curiosity and desire to learn, coupled with my passion for people and tech, I believe make me a valuable asset. Please feel free to have a look at my projects and reach out via my contact details above.
