## ABOUT
üëã I'm Joe (he/him), a junior level Full Stack Engineer based in London. After 8 years of working in marketing and client relations at a senior level at leading tech and music company [The Orchard](theorchard.com), Sony Music, I decided on a change in trajectory and have just completed the 12 week Software Engineering course @[makersacademy](https://makers.tech/). During my career I worked closely with the tools our R&D teams created (mostly data analysis and product ingestion tools), which I could see were becoming more important to my job on a daily basis. Through speaking with some of our SE‚Äôs, I became more and more intrigued by what was happening under the hood of these tools and felt ready for a new challenge. 

Programming is deeply satisfying for me as it is both highly technical and creative. Having trained as a classical guitarist in my youth I have been able to find similarities between the two fields - analysing words/notation, identifying patterns and of course the need for daily practise. Creative thinking, absorbing knowledge and problem solving are all highly enjoyable for me and I like contributing individually, but especially as part of a team. My constant curiosity and desire to learn, coupled with my passion for people and tech, I believe make me a valuable asset. Although I am very much at the start of my journey as an SE, I have laid some strong foundations and I am excited to find a company where I can utilise and build on my existing skill set.

#### Discernment of Client Needs
During my time at [The Orchard](https://www.theorchard.com/) I was a top performer, beginning as a Senior Client Manager for 4 years and ending as a Senior Marketing Manager for the final 4 years. It was not uncommon for me to go above and beyond to understand and meet my clients needs. In one instance I had three different clients all with different important events in the evening. They all desired my attendance so I ended up going to all three across one evening. I was able to keep all clients happy and ensure they all felt equal. This skill was also highly valuable during my time at Makers, where I was able to quickly identify user needs for different programs and create well formed user stories, which helped steer the direction of various projects. It comes natural to me to think about how the user will use the product and try to put myself in their shoes. 

#### Data Analysis 
When working on a particular release I noticed a very large spike in listenership in a particular city but we couldn't identify why. By digging into the data I identified the cause of the jump (there was a TikTok trend in the city using the track) and was able to capitalise on this by arranging a live marketing event including a performance from the artist very quickly. After the event we also saw a conversion from passive fans of one track into active fans who were diving into the artists catalogue. My highly methodical approach to analysing data made adopting a TDD approach to programming a smooth process which I enjoy greatly. Likewise these skills enabled me to get visibility and resolve bugs on both mine and others codebases. 

#### Strong Communication Skills
As part of my previous role I regularly led large planning meetings of both internal teams and external companies and freelancers I had hired for projects. The aim of these meetings was to provide an open space for people to put forward their creative strategies, encourage collaboration and devise a solid route to market by bringing the different pieces together. Through my excellent communication skills I was able to foster exciting, productive and positive environments for people to thrive in. These planning meetings resulted in several silver, gold and platinum releases and a general increase in audience size for the artists I was working with. During my time at Makers I was able to utilise these communication skills to slot into a variety of teams and be an effective and uplifting team member. On several occasions I was Team Lead for the day and led retros which I found highly enjoyable. 

#### Managing & Training Junior Staff
As a senior member of staff it was my responsibility to manage and train several junior members of the team, such as when our department hired a coordinator. Through regular check-ins I was able to empower them by showing genuine interest in their success and wellbeing. I encouraged them to present solutions to problems, rather than solving problems for them. By being an active listener I was able to discuss their long-term career aspirations and help them understand potential career paths. In this particular example this junior member of staff ended up being promoted to a more senior role in the team that we were in desperate need of and rapidly became one of our highest performing team members.
